Back in 2015, I was a 9th grade middle schooler. I have been intereseted in anime and manga for a couple of years, but did not really think much about it. Some of my friends has been to japan, and they have positive experiences. Still, I think nothing of it as I was not really interested in traveling to japan.

My dad has been to japan for a couple of times, this time, requested by probably my sister, he dicided to bring the whole family to Japan, specifically in Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, etc.) I was midly against going all the way to Japan for a vacation, but overall, I'm good as long as I get to spend time with my family, and I can't denied that I'm excited to go to somewhere I've never been to before.

Our trip will be 10 days long. We will be departing from Suvannabhumi aiport at midnight and arrive in the morning in Japan. This way, we have all day to enjoy traveling.

## The Journey Begins

Flight TG623 aboard Thai Airways' Airbus A380 marked the start of our adventure. It was my first time on an A380, and I have to say that it is one of the coolest planes I've ever seen (I don't have much flight experience though haha). My only flight experience was some domestic routes in Thailand, and a trip to Brisbane, Australia when I was in elementary school.

The technology and the sheer size of this plane was just mind blowing. We boarded the plane in Economy class. The whole flight was buttery smooth with no issues whatsoever.

## Arriving at Kansai International Airport

Finally, we arrived at KIX. Once we were out of the airplane, I was surprised by how nice the facility was. As we went there during low season, the airport was quite quiet.

From the terminal, we took a small train that brings us back to the main building. This was very new for me. I'm a little bit of a train guy, and this was definitely cool to see. Back then, we didn't have the SAT-1 terminal at Suvarnabhumi yet, so this was very eye-opening for me.
