Japan's railway system is renowned worldwide for its efficiency, punctuality, and coverage. Join me as I take you through my unforgettable journey across the country by train.

The journey began at Tokyo Station, where I boarded the sleek Shinkansen bullet train. The experience of watching the Japanese countryside zip by at 320 kilometers per hour while Mount Fuji loomed in the distance was simply breathtaking.

## Through the Japanese Alps

Taking the limited express train through the Japanese Alps offered a completely different perspective. The train wound its way through valleys and tunnels, revealing spectacular views of snow-capped peaks and traditional villages nestled in the mountains.

## Coastal Routes to Hokkaido

The final leg of my journey took me along the coast towards Hokkaido. The contrast between the peaceful ocean on one side and the rugged cliffs on the other created a mesmerizing tableau that I'll never forget.
